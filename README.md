##  Hey, I'm Lucas Galdino!ðŸ‘‹

<p>I am a JR Software Developer, I am always studying and improving my skills as a developer, and I always aim to keep myself updated for the job market.

I'm currently studying Information Systems at college and the programming language I use the most is Java as it provides a broad overview about object-oriented programming. Also, I usually use MySQL and SQL Server databases, for the projects required by the our instructor.
