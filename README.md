##  Hey, I'm Lucas Galdino!ðŸ‘‹

<p>I am a JR Software Developer, I am always studying and improving my skills as a developer, and I always aim to keep myself updated for the job market.

I'm currently studying Information Systems at college and the most used technology there is Java, as it provides ample learning about object-oriented programming, and I'm using the MySQL and SQL Server databases as learning, for the specifications required by the our instructor.
